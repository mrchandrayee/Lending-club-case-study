## General Information
- This project aims to analyze and identify key factors that contribute to loan default using Lending Club's dataset.
- The background of the project involves understanding the risk factors in lending and improving loan approval processes by predicting potential defaults.
- **Business Problem**: The project addresses the problem of predicting loan defaults to aid in better risk assessment and decision-making for lending institutions.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is obtained from Lending Club, containing various features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and employment length, among others.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: Higher income levels are generally associated with a lower likelihood of default.
- **Conclusion 2**: Larger loan amounts have a higher tendency for default.
